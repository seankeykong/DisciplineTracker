"# DisciplineTracker" 
This is a basic MEAN stack application I developed to help track student behavior and discipline taken.

I used Node.js as the server with the Express.js framework, Angular.js on the front end, and MongoDB as the database.  This was an unusual situation where they only want it running on a local machine, so I wrote a batch script to start the database and server.  It essentially acts as their "app icon" so when they want ot start they click that file, and open a web browser to begin.
